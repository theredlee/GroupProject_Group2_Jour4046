graduates’ worriedness are not unfounded. L'Oréal (Hong Kong), a French
personal care company Hong Kong Branch, streamed down hiring and increased the
standards on candidates selection. “For the retail function, like customer
service, we have already stopped hiring. Also, we have reduced 90% of our
half-year and one-year internship program this year,” said Megan Tang, the
Assistant Talent Acquisition Manager of L'Oréal.<br>
          <br>“We do not reduce the
starting salary, but we set higher requirements for the candidates. Previously
you just need to have sales-based knowledge to work in a sales position. Still,
now you need to have high learning agility and capability to quickly adapt to
the fast-changing environment and the company’s requirements.”<br>

the founder and CEO of Happyer, a career navigation online platform, mentioned,
“There is an approximate of 50% vacancies drop on their company’s platform
compared to what they have expected in a normal employment environment.”<br>
          <br>From the company's point of
view, Julio has somehow changed their recruitment methods, “Instead of hiring
full-time graduates, our company has opened a lot of non-paid internship
opportunities to students during summer.” He believes that this is a way to “ease
the company’s internal pressure and to offer students a chance to practice
themselves in the workplace at the same time.”<br>

the biggest impact of the pandemic is shifting everything online, Dr. Chandra

has accelerated the trend of the gig economy, boomed the digital labor market,
and provided more chances with freelancers and people who wanted to seek
alternatives and opportunities during the pandemic.”<br>
          <br>“Workers are
being laid off in the restructuring companies. People have to survive. One of
the easiest ways is going online,” Dr. Chandra Yanto added, “People's online
activities are increasing under the pandemic. Entrepreneurs sell their
expertise and skills online, comedians create Youtube channels, and teachers
start offering online tutorials, etc.”<br>
          <br>However, he also mentioned
that young people should not be depressed by the situation since everybody
could pick up new skills online to increase their competitiveness.<br>

is worth noting that students are starting to seek counseling help in job

is a 50% year over year increase in the number of students seeking career
counseling, which shows students suffer in job-seeking under this outbreak and
need more extra help from the school to get through this period.<br>
          <br>Angelina
Chan, the career development manager of the Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU)
career center, said, “Due to the impact of the epidemic, enterprises began to
adopt the mode of mixed virtual and physical internship, in which the
flexibility, as well as the students' problem-solving ability requirements,
were increased compared with the previous requirements. In addition to the
challenges of competence, there is also a relative increase in employers'
expectations of graduates due to resource constraints.”<br>
          <br>“The
number of vacancies is down, but the government and companies are also taking
measures to help the graduates on their employment, so the situation is not too
gloomy,” said Chan. “HKBU has set up Project SEED (Student Engagement,
Enrichment, and Development) under which the university works with alumni and
supporters to offer a range of educational opportunities to enhance students’
personal attributes and readiness for career development.”<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-3">The Government will allocate resources for
creating jobs. Around 30,000 time-limited jobs will be created in both the public
and private sectors in the coming two years for seasoned professionals and
fresh graduates of different skill sets and academic qualifications.<br>
          <br> Positions available for fresh graduates include those
requiring professional or general skills, such as graduate programs in building
surveying, town planning, estate surveying, land surveying, and engineering,
researchers, and executive assistants. <br>
          <br>Besides, the Government is expected to recruit
over 10,000 civil servants this year for filling vacancies arising from
retirement or the creation of new posts. Some 6000 new posts will be created in
2020-21 for enhancing the existing services. The government also planned to
recruit about 5,000 short-term interns this year, increasing about 3,000
positions over last year.<br>
          <br>Although the government is doing a great job in
trying their best to put the pandemic affection on ease, “there is a danger of
spending too much on helping the employment environment,” said Dr. Chandra,
from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.<br>

on the government budget and may cause a deficit in the following years causing
the government to reduce public and social service expenses.” He added.<br>
